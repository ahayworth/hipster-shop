# opentelemetry-collector can be thought of as a proxy for telemetry events.
# It can receive metrics and traces on many protocols including OTLP and Jaeger,
# do some processing, and forward to many observability tools.

# TODO:
#   * add metrics back to this file at some point
#   * add a processor hook to tag stuff as coming from a localdev stack

# This setup for local development targets Grafana Tempo
